# The tip of the iceberg of data analysis.

Data is the future and not just for training artificial intelligence, which is why I consider data analysis to be an important skill for anyone. Extracting and transforming data to then interpret it and obtain relevant information whether to apply changes to your business or simply understand everyday events is a skill that you will definitely like to have. In this repository I present some basic skills that you can learn for free to improve your critical thinking and use tools to facilitate these activities.

**I strongly recommend that you study these concepts until their application is clear, if necessary read other articles or take other courses**


## Articles, courses and videos

### Important basic concepts

Even if you want to solve/identify problems that are not related to a for-profit organization, it is important to understand the concept of BI because it is transferable knowledge, with transferable knowledge I refer to something that you can easily apply to other areas of your life.

#### [Solving problems in your company with data. (article)](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-analyze-data-for-business)

#### [Data life cycle. (article)](It can be helpful to think of research data management in terms of a research data lifecycle and the data-related activities that take place at stages during this lifecycle. The diagram below and the following legend illustrate this lifecyle in seven stages.)

#### [Transactional vs Analytical data. (article)](https://click360.ai/2020/05/03/transactional-vs-analytical-data/)

#### [Looking at data teams with mathematic. (article)](https://dev.to/pedrohgoncalves/data-roles-in-data-teams-and-your-skill-set-using-math-1332)


Understanding how to build data systems to manage and optimize processes.

Different from the data types in programming languages ​​(integer, strings, booleans), in data analysis you have 4 categories that group all types of data. It is important to know the difference between the 4 types because they answer different questions.
#### [4 Types of data. (article)](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/types-of-data/)

---

It is also important to know the difference between the types of data analysis and what problems they can help you solve.

### Data transformation
---

Before you start solving any problem, you need the data, sometimes collecting it is much more challenging than you imagine, for this there are some tools, methodologies and even websites that can facilitate this work, but it is important to understand what the data collection before then.

#### [Basics of data collection. (article)](https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/dctopic.html)

#### [Types of data collection and tools. (article)](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/data-collection-tools/)

---

Data, whether open or closed, commonly has errors, be it duplicate data, null value errors, bad formatting or the like. This actively harms the data analysis work and can give false insights. Cleaning your data and ensuring it is correct is a very important task. It's something that depends a lot on your database but of course there are steps you can apply to any database in order to find such errors.

#### [Data cleansing. (article)][https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-scrubbing]

#### [Data cleasing tools. (article)](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/best-data-cleaning-tools/)

Data engineering is extremely important because data engineers abstract the collection, storage, processing and at least part of the transformation of data to data scientists and analysts.

#### [The magical world of data engineers. (article)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-engineer-do-and-how-do-i-become-one)

#### [Data engineering and B.I architecture. (article)](https://dev.to/pedrohgoncalves/what-is-data-engineering-and-a-bi-architecture-kg4)


Going much deeper into data engineering.

### Statistics
---

Data are records of real-world events and to be able to extract true insights you will need a large layer of data, to be able to “summarize” them you will use central measures, distributions, probability, correlation, etc. To solve different types of problems, learn how and when to apply them correctly.
#### [Principal central measurements. (article)](https://byjus.com/maths/central-tendency/#:~:text=The%20three%20commonly%20used%20measures,called%20the%20measure%20of%20dispersion)

#### [Using correlation in data analysis. (article)](https://www.jmp.com/en_au/statistics-knowledge-portal/what-is-correlation.html)

#### [Variance and standard deviation. (article)](https://byjus.com/maths/variance/)


#### [Introduction to statistics (course)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics) !Recommended


To delve deeper into this and other statistics topics, I recommend.
#### [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (book)](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/149207294X)


Seems a little off topic, but it's not.

### Data visualization.
---

Data visualization is a much more important topic than it seems. By learning data visualization you will realize how much our perceptions are manipulated with graphs and you will also learn how to manipulate, in addition to obviously extracting insights through graphs correctly applied to your problems.

#### [Why data visualization is important. Examples with Tableau. (article)](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization)

#### [Best practices of data visualization. (article)](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-visualization/best-practices-and-tips-for-effective-data-visualization)

### ETL Tools
---

There are several tools that simplify the reduction, transformation and consumption of data. They are highly recommended especially when you have structured data. I'll leave some for you to play with and choose on your own.

#### PowerBI
